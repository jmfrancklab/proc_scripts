    ===========
    s: nddata
        This is an nddata whose "indirect"
        axis is a structured array.  This structured array gives the
        `start_times` and `stop_times` (as fields) for each datapoint
        along the indirect axis.
    filename : str
        Name of the hdf file that contains the power log.
    exp_type : str
        The "experiment type" used to search for the file.

    values: numpy.array
    s: nddata
        (modified in-place)
        When we're done, the axis coordinates for "indirect" are a (not
        structured) array containing the average power recorded on the
        log between each start_time and stop_time.
        The axis coordinate errors are the standard deviations of the
        same.
