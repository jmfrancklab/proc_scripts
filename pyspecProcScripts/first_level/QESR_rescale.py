def QESR_scalefactor(d, calibration_name=None, diameter_name=None):
    """Divide the ESR spectrum by this number so that the double integral
    should be equal to concentration in Î¼M.

    We specifically calculate
    :math:`d^{2} G_{R}  C_{t}  \\sqrt{P}  B_{m}  Q  n_{B}  S  (S + 1) /
    c_{propfactor}`
    (the denominator of equation 2-17 in the E500 manual with :math:`d^2`
    (diameter squared) added in, so that after dividing by this term, we get a
    concentration of spins rather than the total number of spins).

    All of these except :math:`c_{propfactor}` are parameters that we might
    change during an experiment that would change the double integral.
    By dividing the double integral by this, we get a number that is
    proportionate to the concentration of spins.
    The diameter, Q, and proportionality constants are all pulled from the
    pyspecdata config file.

    The constant :math:`c_{propfactor}` is determined by the calibration name.
    Note that a larger :math:`c_{propfactor}` corresponds to a higher
    concentration for the same recorded spectrum.

    Parameters
    ==========
    calibration_name:   str
                        The key corresponding to the appropriate
                        proportionality constant in your pyspecdata config
                        file.  Typically this is one value that doesn't need
                        changing
    diameter_name:      str
                        The key corresponding to the diameter of the capillary
                        tube used in the ESR experiment. This enables us to
                        calculate a reliable concentration regardless of which
                        capillary was used.
    Returns
    =======
    Denominator of equation 2-17 (in the E500 manual) divided by the
    proportionality constant. Also includes a factor of 1e-6 to convert Molar
    to micromolar.
