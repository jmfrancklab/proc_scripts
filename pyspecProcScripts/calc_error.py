    Before declaring the error_path,
    look at an examples such as integration_w_error.py to see how to
    decide which excluded pathways to take the error over.

    Parameters
    ==========
    s: nddata
        Full nddata set in the frequency domain for which the error is being
        propagated.
    frq_slice: tuple
        Frequency range over which the signal resides.
    signal_pathway:   dict
                Dictionary of the path of the desired signal.
    excluded_pathways: list
                List of tuples containing the coherence pathways that are
                to be masked out when calculating the error.
                If no excluded_pathways are fed, the function will apply a mask
                over the signal pathway as well as over the integraion slice in
                all other coherence transfer pathways.
    direct:     str
                Direct axis.
    indirect:   str
                Indirect axis.

    =======

             The error associated with coherence pathways not included in the
             signal pathway.
