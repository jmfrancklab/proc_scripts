proc_scripts
============

This repository contains scripts used in our lab to process and phase
correct Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization NMR (Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance) and other NMR data. It provides several examples of applying
`pyspecdata <http://jmfrancklab.github.io/pyspecdata>`__ to this
problem.

Please check out `the documentation
here. <https://jmfrancklab.github.io/proc_scripts/>`__

The documentation is not extensive, but feel free to contact us jmfranck
[at] syr.edu. Additionally, the code in this directory is undergoing a
major restructuring effort to make it more accessible. However, a
manuscript describing the implementation of this package in the context
of Overhauser DNP (enhanced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) is forthcoming.

This code was principally developed by A Beaton in the Franck lab at
Syracuse University, with some contributions by A Guinness and S Betts.
