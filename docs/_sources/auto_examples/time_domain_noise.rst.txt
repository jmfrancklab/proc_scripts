Here, we want to calculate the time-domain variance to use in error propagation.
But, to make sure we calculate only noise, we want to mask out portions of the frequency 
domain.
We propose that if we use a unitary transform,
Parseval's theorem
tells us we can calculate :math:`\sigma_t^2` (time domain variance)
directly from the frequency-domain variance, *i.e.* :math:`\sigma_
u^2=\sigma_t^2`.
To confirm this, we construct a "spectrum" of pure noise
and generate a frequency-masked noise,
and show that is the same as the 
unmasked time-domain.

    Because we have no signal, this again corresponds to our noise.

    Because we can use the mask in the DCCT domain to exclude signal, that is the number we will want, in general.
    However, here we know that all of our data is noise, and so we should make sure that this matches the naive, direct time-domain calculation.
    If it does, all the following numbers will be about 1.0:
