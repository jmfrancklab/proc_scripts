======================

.. solves the toctree issue, as noted here: https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/445

This is the documentation for a set of processing scripts based on the
`pyspecdata <https://jmfrancklab.github.io/pyspecdata>`_ module.

To **jump into examples**, click
:doc:`here <auto_examples/index>`.
(Note that because this an actively developed project,
you might find some "broken" examples:
this doesn't mean the project isn't maintained,
just that those are features that are still under active development!)
