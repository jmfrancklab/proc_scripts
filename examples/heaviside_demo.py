""" Heaviside Hat Function Demo
===============================
This example demonstrates the use of the `heaviside_time_domain` function
which generates a Heaviside hat function with a width equal to the range
given,
and then returns the IFT of the Heaviside hat
(for use in time-domain integration).

It specifically deals with frequency slices where the bounds
land somewhere in the middle of the
:math:`\\Delta \\nu`
frequency slices that "belong" to each
discrete point,
and does so by by scaling the points at the
(:math:`\\Delta \\nu_I`)
slice boundary to some fraction of 1
(the fraction to which the integral bounds
enter the frequency slice belonging to the
discrete point).
