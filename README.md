# proc_scripts

This repository contains scripts used in our lab to process and phase correct
Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and other NMR data.
It provides several examples of applying [pyspecdata](http://jmfrancklab.github.io/pyspecdata) to this problem.

Please checkout [the documentation here.](https://jmfrancklab.github.io/proc_scripts/)

The documentation is not extensive, but feel free to contact us jmfranck [at] syr.edu.
Additionally, the code in this directory is undergoing a major restructuring effort to make it more accessible.
However, a manuscript describing the implementation of this package in the context of Overhauser DNP
(enhanced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) is forthcoming.
